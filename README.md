# SQL-Datawarehouse-Project
This Project demonstrate the Data Architecture, Data WareHousing, Data Modeling and Data Analytics


  # Project Overview
  This project implements a modern data warehouse solution using SQL Server to consolidate sales data from multiple source systems, enabling     analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

  # Key Features:
   1- End-to-End Data Pipeline: From raw CSV files to insightful analytics
   2- Data Integration: Combine ERP and CRM systems into a unified data model
   3- Data Quality Assurance: Cleansing and validation processes
   4- Business Intelligence: SQL-based analytics for customer, product, and sales insights
   5- Professional Documentation: Clear data model documentation for stakeholders

  # Project Specifications
  Data Engineering Requirements:

   1- Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files
   2- Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis
   3- Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries
   4- Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required
   5- Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams

  Analytics & Reporting Requirements:

   1- Customer Behavior Analysis: Insights into customer patterns and preferences
